            <p>Is it just me or is there someone here?</p>

<p>The air feels like too thin to breathe.<br />
Earth, My Earth! It all seems so distant now. Like a tiny speck of dust in the endless canvas of numerous specks.</p>

<p>My team arrives in two days. Only if my Outer Space Vehicle had not malfunctioned.. I have become a liability to everyone. huh!</p>

<p>Perhaps This is the lack of oxygen talking. I have to conserve oxygen for the near future.<br />
<em>You deepest fears! You have enough your air in your pack for the next 5 days.</em><br />
But as they say: when in space think like a spacer. Everything that can go wrong, <strong>will</strong> go wrong unless I think it through.<br />
Mr Quoter.</p>

<p><em>Duster has always felt a deep connection juggling with words. A quote here. A line from the peom there.
His mates used to call him Duster Wordsworth. Jakiro, his mate from the bunk at Inner Solar Space Station called him DW Longfellow</em><br />
Ahh! Those days of soulful oblivion. Youth always has its charms play out while time is at play sapping out possibilies from the walks of life<br />
Or was It Time adding more possibiities with each tick of the hand. I had never been sure of this</p>

<p><em>A voice mumbes from beyond the recess</em><br />
Rather dont think! Follow protocols. Thats all there is. You have trained long for this! For this <em>Deep Space Exploration</em>. Leaving all folks behind. Even the ones yo want to be around day in and out!<br />
This has always been your deepest dream. Reaching out new frontieers in human knowledge. Pushing frontiers. Making available what is out there - unseen and untouched.</p>

<p><em>You are living your dreams dude..</em>
And so the day continues. anothher day, yet unrecorded but within a human life;s experience..</p>

<h3 id="is-there-something-out-there">Is there something out there?</h3>

<p>Someone (Or something) is watching me. Every step that I take, Every breath very drop of sweat on my sweat is noticed, recorded and analysed for what its wprth.<br />
Back in Earth-II, humans have been usd to surveilance. Privacy is a term least comprehended by folks cause there aint a thing called privacy at erth. CAms, sensors, &ldquo;Edge Sensors&rdquo;. Back in the 21st century, people used to talk a lot about those things. Privacy/ Individuaity. &ldquo;My thoughts are my very own&rdquo;<br />
Scores of books were written. Some fantasy some based on data. Fiction of dystoopian novels, of AI taking over the world. My gaiah!</p>

<p>Oh how foolish were they! Taking decisioss based on emotive strings of uncomprehensible thought. Of analytic thoughts to boost few metric with a large section of public tracked and betted on. The stock market. Second guessing where each other might be doing and what it might do for thenmm and us..</p>

<p>Our Gaiah, My Gaiaih solves all these.. Its now second nature to think that capitalistic entourage will lead you to a dumpyard. CHeck out our Earth - I. The collective thought left it unhabitable for life. Not only did we turn Earth-I to a scrapyard: complelled each earthling to abandone and launch out to space on Day zero,  we destroyed every other life for from earth . Who had no minds on our decisions.. Plants hwat are they? Our generations never knew about them. Sure! fihobytes of data exists on each species that every lived. My living space has a Aloe Vera Pot! But it is just , but a mere projection of light - holographic!</p>

<p>Funny how we use the term holograhics to mean what is seen but isnt there. This term are ages old, but no one know what it really mean. Things which are apparent but are non existent! Hell reality itself is redefined by Arington-Shekhar-Hasimoto paradax. Unlike the EPR paradox, which counterquestioned causality and localism, we now have proof! We dont exist! According to our science? Or somepart of us exist and somepart of us dont! Plain old probablistic euqations from Q mech!</p>

<p>But here we are. We yet exist! We stopped relying on science soon enough as we have stopped relying on traditions and cultural values. On Religion!
Our Art persists in form of suffocating holograms of what was and what can be! But what is, we dont know.. We are never sure of that!</p>
